### Concept

You're a grocery store cashier trying to score as much money as possible in a day. The game takes on a "papers please" kind of gameplay, but only handles a single day.

There is a top-down view of you sitting at the cash register, the belt extending up to the top of the screen. Items will start rolling down the belt, and stop when they reach the scales. In order to start handling a customer's items, the customer must be greeted, which is done by typing the appropriate greeting phrase. Items will start piling up after that. The name of each item is displayed with the item, and has to be typed in order to scan the item. Every customer will have between one and ten items. Once all items have been scanned, the transaction must be made and the receipt printed. This is also done by typing phrases. After this, the next customer (whose items have already started rolling down the belt) can be greeted.

The day has a practically infinite number of customers, and the player needs to process as many as possible before the day is over. When the transaction is made, money is received depending on which and how many items the customer bought.

When the time runs out, the player can finish the last customer before the day ends. Then, a summary of the day is shown, followed by a list of high scores that measure the amount of money the customer scored compared to earlier runs.
